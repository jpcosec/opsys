# Scion autonomy: consistent coordinator and tester contract

## Rationale

_Explain why this task exists or the business driver behind it._

Not provided.

## Goal

_Describe the concrete result this task must produce._

One coherent source contract makes Scion coordinator recover configured current state, progress routine authorized work, select reviewed ready unowned tasks, dispatch fresh executor/tester and reconcile closeout before continuing.

## Scope

_State what is in scope and what is out of scope._

Role source, generated Scion modes/prompts and command examples, explicit runtime context and durable atoms/docs. No replacement lifecycle engine, automatic policy decisions, pi-subagents or unrelated CC tasks.

## Implementation Path

_Outline the expected implementation route or affected surface._

Source contract: correct RoleDoc via SLDB, permitting modeled workflow CLI mutations but no implementation by supervisor. Ordinary implementation questions answered from task/source evidence; escalate only unresolved owner decisions, actual ownership conflicts or external credentials/permissions. Never rerun an accepted review with unchanged input; bound technical retries and report precise blockers instead of broad diagnostic loops. Add optional --context-file JSON to existing runtime template command (and matching generator context kwarg); context keys project, workspace_root, desk_root, source_root, sldb_root are absolute paths within workspace_root except project. Emit DESKOPS_DESK_ROOT, DESKOPS_SOURCE_ROOT, DESKOPS_SLDB_SOURCE_ROOT, DESKOPS_WORKSPACE_ROOT, DESKOPS_SCION_PROJECT and PYTHONPATH plus a supported volume source=workspace_root target=workspace_root. No secrets in context. Preserve no-context behavior. Include tester mode in existing --mode choices, auto-detect tester RoleDoc, and separate tester scope/completion instructions. Coordinator recovers this configured current desk/tools, checks canonical/dirty state, board DAG/review gates and existing ownership (labels/RunDoc/worktrees), skips blocked/owned tasks, selects one reviewed ready leaf. Deterministic task+contract-derived agent names and task/role labels: write run intent BEFORE start and reconcile existing matching Scion child before any new start; duplicate-name protection stays Scion native, not a new scheduler/registry. Explicit --project, --workspace, --type, --harness-auth api-key, --non-interactive and correct subcommand --root flags in examples. Executor -> independent tester -> coordinator validates evidence -> deskops closeout -> reconcile phase -> recover/select again. Failed tester cannot close; request bounded correction and fresh test. Waiting-for-child uses Scion blocked/completion notifications (already subscribed); only real human decisions ask_user. Capture source atom before operator docs, generate from source, test YAML/modes/context and actual command examples; runtime task supplies hooks/bootstrap and unattended integration.

## Validation

_List the checks required before this task can close._

- pytest tests/test_scion_runtime.py
- affected CLI help/output goldens if tester mode adds a choice
- real unattended coordinator -> executor -> independent tester -> closeout/continue integration

## Done When

_Name the observable condition that makes the task complete._

No source/installed instruction contradiction; tester materialization correct; routine questions not blanket ask_user; dispatch checks readiness/ownership and restart identity. Focused tests pass and live integrated experiment demonstrates the loop without parent prompts.
