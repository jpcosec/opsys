# Desk Board

## Purpose

_Explain what this board routes and why it exists._



## Notes

_Add short operational notes about the current routed set._

- Make role prompts sldb-tracked RoleDocs with pi-agent materialization [active] - Roles become canonical sldb-tracked documents; installed pi agents become regenerated artifacts; drift is detectable via `deskops drift check`.

## Task Details

_Generated from the task references above._

- Tasks without a `tags:` key validate again after the f6 TaskDoc contract [draft] - A task file with no `tags:` key validates as tags=[], and `desk update --apply` repairs stores whose tasks predate f6.
