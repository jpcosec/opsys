# Guardrail: ready phases prove dependencies and non-overlap

## What

_Define the context or guardrail this pill carries._

Treat a board phase as ready only when its tasks form a real dependency layer: their prerequisites are satisfied and their planned operational changes do not overlap.

## Why

_Explain why this context matters for safe execution._

If a phase is only a semantic grouping or a wishful backlog slice, parallel execution becomes unsafe and phase closeout no longer proves integration at the right layer.

## When

_Describe when an agent should apply this pill._

Apply this pill whenever a board chooses the next phase, groups tasks for parallel execution, or claims that multiple tasks are ready at once.

## Where

_Name the files, surfaces, or scope this pill applies to._

Applies to `desk/rituals/phase.md`, `desk/tasks/Board.md`, dependency planning, and any future phase-aware execution tooling.

## How

_Describe the correct way to apply this guidance._

Name the dependency proof explicitly, check that no task in the candidate phase still depends on another task in the same layer, and check that the planned touched surfaces can be executed without operational overlap.

## How Not

_Describe the shortcut or failure mode to avoid._

Do not call a backlog theme a phase. Do not group tasks into one phase just because they sound related if they still depend on one another or change the same operational surface unsafely.
