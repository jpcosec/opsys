# Ordered prose steps; not document references
steps:
- 1. Confirm the incoming handoff includes passing evidence for the contract, validations,
  and bound pills.
- 1. Invalidate or fix stale tests if they no longer prove the intended behavior.
- 1. Run the required validation commands and confirm they pass.
- 1. Run `deskops closeout verify --task <id>` and require all reported gates to pass
  before the tool-made commit.
- 1. Confirm the task satisfied each bound pill and that no matching board-routed
  pill was missed during execution.
- 1. If the task bound pills, check whether the task `references` list already points
  to an atom that captures any durable residue; tasks with no bound pills pass this
  check trivially.
- 1. If verify reports a changed file with no live atom/materialization link, route
  that gap into an explicit follow-up reference before closing.
- 1. If verify reports a rendered artifact with a sibling source but no declared `source_atoms`
  or `provenance`, fix the artifact metadata before closing.
- 1. Remove stale context docs that are no longer needed.
- '1. Leave removal and untracking to deskops closeout commit: it removes the task
  from the Board, untracks it, and deletes the bundle in the closing commit. Do not
  delete or untrack by hand first.'
- 1. If the task's subject no longer exists, close it with `deskops closeout supersede`,
  naming a reason and at least one resolvable ref, and stop here instead of running
  the closeout commit.
- 1. Close the task with `deskops closeout commit` as the one entry point and the
  mandatory final gate.

# Closeout ritual for tracked desk tasks

## Purpose

_Explain why this ritual exists._

Close a desk task only after tests, board cleanup, store cleanup when needed, and a dedicated closing commit, while leaving shared integration, pill reconciliation, and next-phase preparation to the phase ritual. `deskops closeout commit` is the one closure entry point: it runs the closeout gates, removes the task from the Board, removes the bundle, makes exactly one commit with the route's trailers, and records the index entry. `deskops advance` does not close tasks. `deskops closeout supersede` is the only way to close a task whose subject no longer exists: it records `superseded` and the stated reason instead of pretending the work was done. `deskops closeout retire` removes a task that was already resolved before the ritual lifecycle (status resolved, closed, done or complete), naming the commit that resolved it, so legacy history leaves desk/tasks without passing through evidence gates it predates. When a closed task was never committed, the closeout first records its body in one commit (`desk: registra <task stem>`, with `Task-Id` and `Closeout-Mode: record` trailers) before the closing commit removes it, so the task's rationale, goal, scope, validation, and done-when stay in git history.

## Trigger

_State when this ritual should start._

Start when the implementation work for a task is complete.

## Preconditions

_List the conditions that must hold before running the ritual._

- Relevant tests pass.
- Bound pill obligations were checked during testing.
- If the task bound one or more pills, closeout reviewed whether any durable pill residue now needs an atom reference in the task `references` list.
- The testing-to-closeout handoff gate is explicit.
- Any stale context docs are ready to be removed.
- The closing change is ready to commit.
- For a superseded task, the reason states that the subject no longer exists and the ref resolves to an ancestor commit or an existing path.

## Validation

_List the checks that prove the ritual was performed correctly._

- The task is gone from desk/tasks.
- The board no longer routes the task.
- No bound pill is left unmet or unverified.
- Tasks with bound pills either reference an atom in `references` or explicitly affirm that no durable pill knowledge needed graduation.
- `deskops closeout verify --task <id>` passes before the tool-made closeout commit.
- Verify reports resolvable test evidence, changed-file atom/materialization coverage (or a routed follow-up when coverage is not live yet), and commit evidence.
- Changed generated artifacts with a sibling source declare `source_atoms` or `provenance` so the source relation is explicit.
- The local store stays consistent after untracking.
- `deskops closeout commit` made exactly one closing commit, with the route's trailers, and recorded its index entry.
- The task was not treated as closed before the final commit gate.
- A superseded task was closed with `deskops closeout supersede`, not with a closeout commit that claims completed work.
- The superseded closing commit carries `Closeout-Mode: superseded`, `Closeout-Reason`, and `Closeout-Ref` trailers.

## Failure Modes

_List common mistakes this ritual prevents._

- Deleting the task before the closing commit exists.
- Leaving a stale tracked document in the store.
- Calling a task closed while tests still fail.
- Closing from green tests alone without checking pill coverage.
- Removing a pill-bound task without checking whether its durable residue should now point at an atom.
- Treating board cleanup or task deletion as equivalent to the final commit gate.
- Closing a task whose subject was removed as if the work had been done.
- Running `deskops closeout supersede` without a reason or a resolvable ref.

## Completion

_Describe what completion looks like._

The task has left the active workspace and its closure is recorded by its own git commit. If it was the last open task in the current phase, the board must still pass through phase closeout before the next phase begins.
