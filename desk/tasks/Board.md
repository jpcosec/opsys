# Desk Board

## Purpose

_Explain what this board routes and why it exists._



## Notes

_Add short operational notes about the current routed set._

- Make role prompts sldb-tracked RoleDocs with pi-agent materialization [active] - Roles become canonical sldb-tracked documents; installed pi agents become regenerated artifacts; drift is detectable via `deskops drift check`.

## Task Details

_Generated from the task references above._

- deskops rebuilt on pron (total refactor, fireproof test) [active] - In worktree `../deskops-pron` (branch `deskops-pron`): deskops' Python
rewritten so every sldb/kgdb contact goes through a single seam
(`deskops/world.py` → `pron.World`), CLI verb surface preserved 1:1, the 273
existing tests passing as the behavioral contract, and a gap log
(`desk/pron-gap-log.md`) capturing every pron limitation found for pron's
inbox.
