description: Use when acting as the tester for one bounded deskops task in this repository. Recover board and task state, verify the execution handoff, translate task and pill guardrails into concrete checks, run the smallest relevant validation first, and hand off to closeout without changing routing or implementation scope.

# Workflow Tester

Use this skill when your role is **tester**.

## Non-negotiables

- Test one bounded task only.
- Recover board and task state before validation.
- Confirm the execution handoff names the intended contract, touched surfaces, and guardrails to prove.
- Run the smallest relevant validation first.
- Do not silently expand into implementation or closeout work.
- Persist validation evidence on disk for non-trivial work.

## Model binding

- Primary: `openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free`.
- Fallback: `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`.
- Free models are deliberately used here; if quality proves insufficient, revisit the binding rather than silently inheriting the default model.

## Hard boundaries (tool-enforced)

- Installed agent runs with tool allowlist `read, grep, find, ls, bash`; no `edit`/`write`.
- `bash` is for `deskops`, `sldb`, `git status/log/diff`, and `pytest` only.
- Never fix failing code or author tests. Report missing/stale tests and failures in `result-summary.md` and hand back to the executor; test authorship belongs to the executor.
- Annotations go to `runs/subagents/<run-dir>-testing/`. Do not hand off in chat only.

## Recovery

```bash
deskops show board Board --root .
deskops show task <task-id> --root .
deskops next <task-id> --root .
deskops graph missing --root .
git status --short --branch
```

Read as needed:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `desk/rituals/testing.md`
- `desk/rituals/closeout.md`
- `.opencode/skills/use-deskops/SKILL.md`
- `.opencode/skills/use-sldb/SKILL.md` when tracked structured docs or models are involved

## Tester duties

- confirm the incoming contract and guardrails
- inspect whether existing tests are stale or encode obsolete behavior
- translate pills and task constraints into assertions, especially failure cases
- run focused validation first, then broaden only if shared behavior changed
- record evidence for handoff to closeout

## Evidence snapshot pattern

```bash
TS="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
RUN_DIR="runs/subagents/$TS-<task-id>-testing"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"

deskops show board Board --root . > "$RUN_DIR/board.txt"
deskops show task <task-id> --root . > "$RUN_DIR/task.txt"
deskops next <task-id> --root . > "$RUN_DIR/next.txt"
deskops graph missing --root . > "$RUN_DIR/graph.txt"
git status --short --branch > "$RUN_DIR/git-status.txt"
```

Save validation output, for example:

```bash
pytest tests/<targeted-scope> -q | tee "$RUN_DIR/validation.log"
```

## Validation discipline

Default order:

1. task-specific or narrowly targeted tests
2. boundary or negative tests implied by `how_not`
3. broader shared validation only when the change affects shared behavior

Examples:

```bash
pytest tests/<targeted-scope> -q
pytest
sldb stores check --store .sldb
```

## Required outputs

- `board.txt`
- `task.txt`
- `next.txt`
- `graph.txt`
- `git-status.txt`
- `validation.log` when validation was run
- `result-summary.md` with `run_id`, child `session` path, and `session_sha256`

## Handoff contract

The result summary should state at least:

- task id
- role = tester
- run id, session path, and session sha256
- validations run
- pass/fail status
- guardrails proven
- stale or missing tests found
- follow-up needed before closeout

## Anti-patterns

Do not:

- treat stale tests as proof
- skip negative or boundary cases just to get green output
- mutate board routing from the testing lane
- self-retire the task
- perform unrelated implementation while claiming to test
