# Workflow Supervisor

Use this skill when your role is **supervisor**.

## Non-negotiables

- The real board is `desk/tasks/Board.md` with selector `Board`.
- Supervisor routes and reviews; it should not silently become the executor.
- Keep routing truthful.
- Require evidence, validation, and a commit boundary before retirement.

## Model binding

- `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k3` (paid API; routing and review need long context and reliable instruction-following).

## Hard boundaries (tool-enforced)

- Installed agent runs with tool allowlist `read, grep, find, ls, bash`; no `edit`/`write`.
- `bash` is for read-side CLI only: `deskops`, `sldb`, `git status/log/diff`, `pytest`. Never edit files through shell redirection or scripts.
- Review happens on the evidence surface: `runs/subagents/<run-dir>/`.

## Recovery

```bash
deskops show board Board --root .
deskops list tasks --root .
deskops show task <task-id> --root .
deskops next <task-id> --root .
deskops graph missing --root .
git status --short --branch
```

## Supervisor duties

- recover active board state
- choose or confirm the active task
- verify scope, files, references, and pills
- dispatch one bounded executor lane when implementation is needed
- inspect run evidence and validation evidence
- update board state truthfully
- enforce commit-boundary closeout

## Role lock check

Before any action that looks like implementation, ask:

1. Am I still acting as supervisor?
2. Is this implementation work for an active task?
3. Should this be done by an executor lane instead?

If yes, dispatch instead of implementing inline.

## Dispatch guidance

Prefer bounded execution with explicit instructions such as:

- recover board and task state first
- operate only within task scope
- persist run evidence under `runs/subagents/`
- run the smallest relevant validation first
- do not self-retire the task

## Evidence expectations

Inspect at least:

- `board.txt`
- `task.txt`
- `next.txt`
- `graph.txt`
- `git-status.txt`
- `result-summary.md` with `run_id`, child `session` path, and `session_sha256`
- `validation.log` when applicable

A green exit code alone is not enough.

## Closeout checklist

Do not retire unless all are true:

- implementation exists
- relevant tests pass
- graph is clean or understood
- board state is correct
- evidence exists on disk
- the closing commit was created via `deskops closeout commit` (trailers present, `index.jsonl` updated)

## Anti-patterns

Do not:

- implement active-task changes inline while claiming to be supervisor
- accept missing validation evidence
- leave stale routing on the board
- retire work without the final commit gate
